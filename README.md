### A. How It Works:
This script captures video from your webcam, processes each frame to detect specific color ranges (yellow in this case), and then highlights the contours of detected areas on the screen.

#### 1. Initialization:
- The script starts by importing the necessary libraries: cv2 (OpenCV for image processing) and numpy for handling arrays.
- A video capture object cap is created to access the webcam.

#### 2. Frame Processing:
- The script enters an infinite loop where it reads frames from the webcam.
- Each frame is converted from BGR color space to HSV color space. HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) makes it easier to define color ranges.

#### 3. Color Detection:
- A color range for yellow is defined using lower_y and upper_y.
- A mask is created using cv2.inRange() that isolates pixels within the yellow range.

#### 4. Contour Detection:
- The mask is further processed using cv2.threshold() to create a binary image that can be used for contour detection.
- Contours are found using cv2.findContours() and drawn onto the frame using cv2.drawContours().

#### 5. Display:
- The original frame, the mask, and the image with drawn contours are displayed in separate windows.
- Exit Condition: The script waits for a key press to exit the loop. Once a key is pressed, all windows are closed, and the video capture is released.

### B. Prerequisites:
Ensure you have OpenCV and NumPy installed:
- pip install opencv-python numpy

### C. Usage:
- This script is useful for basic color-based object detection and can be adapted for various computer vision applications.
- Simply run the script, and it will open your webcam. The script will display the live feed, a mask showing the detected yellow areas, and the contours around these areas.
Press any key to exit.
